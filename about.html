      <p>I am an Information Technology student specializing in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), with a strong interest in integrating technology and business processes. My academic journey has provided me with knowledge in database management, systems analysis, programming, and ERP platforms. I take this course beacause may aunt and uncle is an senior developer and IT is a high paying job so papaldo tayo dienhh keysa sa scatter or baccarat pre. I want to learn more in businesses in platforms of Information Technologies to educate my self more specially in coding, and problem solving.
